## Sequencer

- User provided
- Private Key used on op-node to sign P2P transactions
- No funding required
- Optionally set for op-node

## Batcher

- User provided
- Private Key used to send transaction batches to L1 (Batch Inbox address?)
- Funds required on L1
- Set for op-batcher

### Batch Inbox

- Seems to be randomly generated by op-deployer (?)
- It's set on rollup.json (.batch_inbox_address) by op-deployer

## Proposer

- User provided
- Private Key used to submit state roots from L2 to L1 (to disputeGameFactoryProxyAddress contract)
    - It calls create() method from disputeGameFactoryProxyAddress which creates a new contract on each call
- Funds required on L1

### PermissionedDisputeGameProxy

- Created by op-proposer
- Seems to be the targeted by op-proposer to submit proposals to the PermissionedDisputeGame contract


## Deployer

- User provided
- Used by op-deployer to deploy / initialize network.
- Funds required on L1
- Calls OPCM (OP Contracts Manager) method Deploy (0x613e827b). This contract is predeployed on known networks. Contracts created are summarized below, **this is NOT an exhaustive list of available methods, only relevant ones are shown**.
  - Input:
    - roles (list of addresses: ProxyAdminOwner, ConfigOwner, batcher, proposer, signer, unsafeBlockSigner)
    - base fees
    - l2 chain id

Notes

- All the addresses for the contracts above can be retrieved with op-deployer: ```op-deployer inspect l1```


# Addresses found on rollup.json

- ```.genesis.system_config.batcherAddr``` --> Batcher address
- ```.batch_inbox_address``` --> Batch Inbox address
- ```.deposit_contract_address``` --> This matches the optimismPortalProxyAddress contract deployed by op-deployer Deploy() call
- ```.l1_system_config_address``` --> This matches the systemConfigProxyAddress contract deployed by op-deployer Deploy() call
- ```.protocol_versions_address``` --> This seems to be a contract managed by Optimism, with the only purpose of having a way to query recommended/required version on-chain
